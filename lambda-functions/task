1. Easy
Given a list of numbers nums = [2, 5, 8, 11, 14].
Filter only even numbers using filter and lambda.
Expected result: [2, 8, 14]

2. Medium
Given a list names = ["alice", "BOB", "ChArLiE"].
Using map and lambda, make all names start with a capital letter and the rest lowercase.
Expected result: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']

3. Medium+
Given a list nums = [3, 6, 9, 12].
Using reduce and lambda, calculate the product of all elements.
Expected result: 1944

4. Hard
Given a list of words words = ["python", "is", "really", "powerful"].
Sort it by word length in descending order using sorted and lambda.
Expected result: ['powerful', 'really', 'python', 'is']

5. Challenge
Given a list of dictionaries:
people = [
    {"name": "Alice", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Bob", "age": 19},
    {"name": "Charlie", "age": 30}
]
Using filter and lambda, select only those whose age >= 21,
then use map to get a list of their names.
Expected result: ['Alice', 'Charlie']
